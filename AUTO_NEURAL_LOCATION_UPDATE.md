# Auto-Neural Message Location & Timing Update

## Changes Made

### ✅ **Faster Auto-Hide Timer**
- **Before**: 5 seconds display time
- **After**: 2.5 seconds display time (much faster)
- **Pulse warning**: Now at 2 seconds instead of 4 seconds

### ✅ **Better Location**
- **Before**: Full-width bottom of sidebar
- **After**: Compact top-right corner
- **Design**: Much smaller footprint, less intrusive

### ✅ **Improved Text**
- **Before**: "auto-neural mode • pin to persist" (long)
- **After**: "auto • pin" (concise and clear)

### ✅ **Enhanced Animations**
- **Entry**: Scales in from right with smooth transition
- **Exit**: Scales out to right with fade
- **Position**: `top-2 right-2` for minimal interference

## Benefits
1. **Less intrusive**: Compact corner placement doesn't block content
2. **Faster response**: 2.5 seconds is quick enough to not annoy users
3. **Better UX**: Clear, concise messaging
4. **Professional feel**: Smooth, polished animations

## Technical Details
- **Z-index**: `z-50` to ensure visibility over other elements
- **Responsive**: Works with both animated and non-animated modes  
- **State management**: Proper reset when pinning/unpinning
- **Performance**: Hardware-accelerated animations

The auto-neural message now appears briefly in the top-right corner, provides clear guidance, and disappears quickly without being intrusive.
