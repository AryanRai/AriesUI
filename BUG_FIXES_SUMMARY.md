# Bug Fixes Summary - MainContent Grid Component

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Slow Nest Movement ✅
**Problem:** Nest containers were dragging slowly despite optimization attempts.
**Solution:** 
- Removed throttling specifically for nest dragging 
- Added early return to bypass all other processing for nest movement
- Direct state update without push physics for maximum performance

### 2. Widgets Getting Pushed Away When Dragging to Nest ✅
**Problem:** Push physics was interfering with nest drops, pushing widgets away before they could be dropped into nests.
**Solution:**
- Added detection for when a widget is hovering over a nest
- Disabled push physics entirely when dragging over a nest
- Added visual feedback (green highlight) to indicate valid drop zones
- Only apply push physics when NOT hovering over a nest

### 3. Resize Cursor Bug ✅
**Problem:** Resize cursor would get stuck after resizing widgets/nests.
**Solution:**
- Added proper cursor setting in `handleResizeMouseDown` based on resize handle
- Added cursor reset to default in `handleMouseUp` 
- Created cursor map for all resize handles (nw-resize, n-resize, etc.)

### 4. Invisible Drag Boundary ✅
**Problem:** Widgets couldn't be dragged beyond certain invisible boundaries.
**Solution:**
- Verified all `Math.max(0, ...)` constraints were already removed
- Confirmed push physics allows negative coordinates
- Ensured no artificial boundaries in drag calculations
- Grid now allows complete freedom of movement including negative coordinates

## Technical Details

### Code Changes Made:
1. **Mouse move throttling bypass for nests:**
   ```tsx
   // Skip throttling for nest dragging - instant response
   if (dragState.draggedType !== "nest" && now - lastMouseMoveTime < throttleInterval) {
     return // Skip this frame to maintain performance for widgets only
   }
   ```

2. **Push physics bypass for nest drops:**
   ```tsx
   // DISABLE push physics when dragging over a nest to prevent widgets from being pushed away
   if (hoverNest) {
     // Skip push physics entirely when hovering over a nest
     // ... direct position update only
     return // Early return to skip push physics
   }
   ```

3. **Cursor management:**
   ```tsx
   // Set proper cursor based on handle to prevent cursor bugs
   const cursorMap: Record<ResizeHandle, string> = {
     'nw': 'nw-resize', 'n': 'n-resize', 'ne': 'ne-resize',
     'e': 'e-resize', 'se': 'se-resize', 's': 's-resize',
     'sw': 'sw-resize', 'w': 'w-resize'
   }
   document.body.style.cursor = cursorMap[handle]
   ```

4. **Cursor reset on mouse up:**
   ```tsx
   const handleMouseUp = () => {
     // Reset cursor to default to fix resize cursor bug
     document.body.style.cursor = 'default'
     // ... rest of function
   }
   ```

### Performance Improvements:
- **Nest dragging:** Now instant response with no throttling
- **Widget-to-nest drops:** Smooth without push physics interference
- **Resize operations:** No more cursor getting stuck
- **Infinite grid:** Complete freedom of movement

### Visual Feedback:
- Green highlight when dragging widgets over valid nest drop zones
- Immediate visual response for nest movement
- Proper cursor changes during resize operations
- No more invisible boundaries or constraints

## Testing Recommendations:
1. Test nest dragging for smooth, instant response
2. Test widget dragging from main grid to nests
3. Test widget resizing to ensure cursor resets properly
4. Test dragging widgets to extreme negative coordinates
5. Test all resize handles (corners and edges)

All fixes maintain the existing animation system and performance optimizations while resolving the specific UX issues identified.
